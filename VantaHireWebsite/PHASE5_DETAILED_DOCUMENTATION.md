app.get("/api/admin/stats", requireRole(['admin']), async (req, res) => {
  const stats = await storage.getAdminStats();
  res.json(stats);
});
```

### Secure Data Operations

- **Transaction Safety**: Atomic operations for data integrity
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive validation on all admin operations
- **Audit Trail**: Tracking of all administrative actions

### Permission Verification
```typescript
// Role-based access enforcement
export function requireRole(roles: string[]) {
  return (req: any, res: any, next: any) => {
    if (!req.user || !roles.includes(req.user.role)) {
      return res.status(403).json({ error: "Access denied" });
    }
    next();
  };
}
```

## ðŸš€ Technical Architecture

### Storage Layer Implementation
```typescript
// Comprehensive admin statistics
async getAdminStats(): Promise<AdminStats> {
  const jobsResult = await db.select({ count: count() }).from(jobs);
  const activeJobsResult = await db.select({ count: count() }).from(jobs).where(eq(jobs.isActive, true));
  const pendingJobsResult = await db.select({ count: count() }).from(jobs).where(eq(jobs.status, 'pending'));
  // Additional statistics gathering...
}

// Detailed job information with application counts
async getAllJobsWithDetails(): Promise<JobWithDetails[]> {
  const jobsWithDetails = await db.select({...}).from(jobs).innerJoin(users, eq(jobs.postedBy, users.id));
  const applicationCounts = await db.select({...}).from(applications).groupBy(applications.jobId);
  // Combine data for comprehensive view...
}
```
