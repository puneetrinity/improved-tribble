## ðŸ›  Schema Updates Implemented

### Database Schema Changes
```typescript
export const applications = pgTable("applications", {
  id: serial("id").primaryKey(),
  jobId: integer("job_id").notNull().references(() => jobs.id),
  name: text("name").notNull(),
  email: text("email").notNull(),
  phone: text("phone").notNull(),
  resumeUrl: text("resume_url").notNull(),
  coverLetter: text("cover_letter"),
  
  // Phase 3 Additions
  status: text("status").default("submitted").notNull(),
  notes: text("notes"),
  lastViewedAt: timestamp("last_viewed_at"),
  downloadedAt: timestamp("downloaded_at"),
  appliedAt: timestamp("applied_at").defaultNow().notNull(),
  updatedAt: timestamp("updated_at").defaultNow().notNull(),
});
```

### Status Flow Design
```
submitted â†’ reviewed â†’ shortlisted â†’ hired/rejected
    â†“         â†“           â†“
downloaded (can occur at any stage)
```

### Validation Schema
```typescript
export const insertApplicationSchema = createInsertSchema(applications).extend({
  status: z.enum(["submitted", "reviewed", "shortlisted", "rejected", "downloaded"]).optional(),
  notes: z.string().max(1000).optional(),
});
```

- Ownership verification for all applications
- Returns count of successfully updated records

#### 3. Application View Tracking
```http
PATCH /api/applications/:id/view
Authorization: Required (recruiter/admin)

**Behavior**: Automatically sets status to 'reviewed' and records timestamp

#### 4. Resume Download Tracking
```http
PATCH /api/applications/:id/download
Authorization: Required (recruiter/admin)
```
**Behavior**: Sets status to 'downloaded' and records download timestamp

## ðŸ”’ Security Implementation

### Role-Based Access Control
```typescript
// Ownership verification for recruiters
if (req.user!.role !== 'admin') {
  const application = await storage.getApplication(applicationId);
  const job = await storage.getJob(application.jobId);
  if (!job || job.postedBy !== req.user!.id) {
    return res.status(403).json({ error: "Access denied" });
  }
}
```

### Security Features
- **Route Protection**: All endpoints require authentication
- **Ownership Verification**: Recruiters can only manage their own job applications
- **Admin Override**: Admins have full access to all applications
- **Input Validation**: Zod schemas validate all incoming data
- **SQL Injection Prevention**: Parameterized queries via Drizzle ORM

---

## ðŸš€ Technical Architecture

### Storage Layer Enhancements
```typescript
// New storage interface methods
async updateApplicationStatus(id: number, status: string, notes?: string): Promise<Application | undefined>
async updateApplicationsStatus(ids: number[], status: string, notes?: string): Promise<number>
async markApplicationViewed(id: number): Promise<Application | undefined>
async markApplicationDownloaded(id: number): Promise<Application | undefined>
```

### Query Optimization
- **Efficient Bulk Updates**: Single query for multiple records
- **Indexed Searches**: Database indexes on frequently queried fields
- **Conditional Loading**: Data fetched only when needed
- **Cache Invalidation**: Smart React Query cache management
