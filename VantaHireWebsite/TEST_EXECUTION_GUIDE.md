# VantaHire Test Execution Guide

## Quick Start Testing

The VantaHire platform now includes a comprehensive automated testing framework. Here's how to run tests:

### Prerequisites

1. Ensure the application is running:
```bash
npm run dev
```

2. Install testing dependencies (already included):
- Vitest for unit and integration tests
- Playwright for E2E tests
- K6 for performance testing
- Supertest for API testing

### Running Individual Test Suites

**Unit Tests** - Test individual components and functions:
```bash
npx vitest run test/unit
```

**Integration Tests** - Test API endpoints and workflows:
```bash
npx vitest run test/integration
```

**Security Tests** - Validate security measures:
```bash
npx vitest run test/security
```

**E2E Tests** - Test complete user workflows:
```bash
npx playwright test
```

**Performance Tests** - Load and stress testing:
```bash
k6 run test/performance/load-test.js
```

### Running All Tests

```bash
npx vitest run
```

### Test Coverage

Generate coverage report:
```bash
npx vitest run --coverage
```

### Interactive Testing

Watch mode for development:
```bash
npx vitest
```

Test UI interface:
```bash
npx vitest --ui
```

## Test Data Management

### Mock Data Factories
The testing framework includes realistic data generators:
- Job postings with complete attributes
- User accounts with various roles
- Applications with authentic information

### MSW Integration
Mock Service Worker provides:
- API endpoint simulation
- Authentication state mocking
- Error scenario testing

## CI/CD Integration

### GitHub Actions Workflow
Automated testing includes:
- Unit test execution on pull requests
- Integration test validation
- Security scan completion
- Performance regression detection
- Cross-browser E2E testing

### Coverage Requirements
- **Unit Tests**: 80% minimum coverage
- **API Endpoints**: 100% coverage for critical paths
- **Security Tests**: All authentication flows
- **E2E Tests**: Primary user workflows

## Performance Benchmarks

### Target Metrics
- **Job Search**: < 500ms response time
- **Application Submission**: < 1s completion
- **AI Analysis**: < 2s processing time
- **Page Load**: < 2s initial render
- **Error Rate**: < 1% across all operations

### Load Testing Scenarios
1. **Normal Load**: 50 concurrent users
2. **Peak Load**: 200 concurrent users
3. **Stress Test**: 500 concurrent users
4. **AI Service**: Rate limiting validation

## Accessibility Testing

### Automated Checks
- **axe-playwright**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- **Screen Reader**: Keyboard navigation validation
- **Color Contrast**: Visual accessibility standards
- **Focus Management**: Tab order and visibility

## Security Validation

### Authentication Testing
- Session fixation prevention
- Role-based access control
- Password security validation
- Logout session cleanup

### Input Validation
- SQL injection attempt blocking
- Cross-site scripting prevention
- File upload security checks
- Path traversal protection

### Rate Limiting
- Login attempt throttling
- API endpoint protection
- Bulk operation controls
- AI service usage limits

## Test Maintenance

### Regular Updates
- Keep test data current with application features
- Update security tests based on threat landscape
- Maintain performance benchmarks
- Review accessibility standards compliance

### Best Practices
- Run tests before every deployment
- Monitor test execution time trends
- Update mock data to reflect real scenarios
- Maintain test isolation and independence

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Database Connection**: Ensure test database is available
2. **API Rate Limits**: Tests may trigger rate limiting
3. **File Uploads**: Check file permissions and paths
4. **Browser Dependencies**: Ensure Playwright browsers are installed

### Debug Mode
Run tests with debugging enabled:
```bash
DEBUG=1 npx vitest run
```

### Test Isolation
Each test runs independently with clean state:
- Fresh database for each test suite
- Isolated authentication sessions
- Clean mock data for each scenario

This comprehensive testing framework ensures VantaHire maintains high quality, security, and performance standards across all features and user workflows.
