## Running Tests

### Individual Test Suites

```bash
# Unit tests
npm run test:unit

# Integration tests
npm run test:integration

# E2E tests
npm run test:e2e

# Security tests
npm run test:security

# Performance tests
npm run test:performance
```

### Coverage Reports

```bash
# Generate coverage report
npm run test:coverage

# Interactive test UI
npm run test:ui

# Watch mode for development
npm run test:watch
```

### CI/CD Integration

The testing framework includes GitHub Actions workflow for:
- Automated test execution on pull requests
- Coverage reporting
- Performance benchmarking
- Security scanning
- Cross-browser E2E testing

## Test Configuration

### Vitest Configuration

**File**: `vitest.config.ts`

Key settings:
- JSDOM environment for React testing
- Coverage thresholds (80% minimum)
- Path aliases for clean imports
- Test setup and teardown

### Playwright Configuration

**File**: `playwright.config.ts`

Key settings:
- Multi-browser testing (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
- Mobile device simulation
- Screenshot and video capture on failures
- Accessibility testing integration

### K6 Performance Configuration

**File**: `test/performance/load-test.js`

Key settings:

## Performance Benchmarks

### Target Metrics

- **Job Search Response**: < 500ms
- **Application Submission**: < 1s
- **AI Analysis**: < 2s (95th percentile)
- **Page Load Time**: < 2s
- **Error Rate**: < 1%

### Load Testing Scenarios

1. **Normal Load**: 50 concurrent users
2. **Peak Load**: 200 concurrent users
3. **Stress Test**: 500 concurrent users
4. **Spike Test**: Rapid user increase simulation

## Test Maintenance

### Best Practices

1. **Keep Tests Independent**: Each test should run in isolation
2. **Use Realistic Data**: Mock data should reflect real-world scenarios
3. **Test Edge Cases**: Include boundary conditions and error scenarios
4. **Maintain Test Data**: Keep factories and mocks up to date
5. **Regular Test Reviews**: Ensure tests remain relevant and effective
